    "Ваше завдання - побити єдиний бенчмарк в [змаганні](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flight-delays-2017) на Kaggle Inclass. Докладних інструкцій не буде, буде тільки тезисно описано, як отримано цей бенчмарк. Звичайно, за допомогою Xgboost. Сподіваюся, на даному етапі курсу вам досить кинути півтора погляду на дані, щоб зрозуміти, що це той тип завдання, в якій затягне Xgboost. Але перевірте ще Catboost."
